## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [Ceevee theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-ceevee)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the Ceevee Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install ceevee
```

# Configuration
Configuration of Ceevee theme consist of two parts:
* configuration file (from [skeleton](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-ceevee-site/commits?author=hexplor)): "user/config/site.yaml"
* header variables (inside markdown files)

In configuration file you can set basic values for header, footer and general.
In markdown files, you can manage page content and overall look of the separate section. For example, below is a portfolio.md header section:

```markdown
portfolio:
  - title: "Creative Minds"
    img: portfolio-01.jpg
    img_text: View More
    img_url: "#"
    content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc ultricies nulla non metus pulvinar imperdiet. Praesent non adipiscing libero."
```

In above example you can specify title, image, roll over text, url and content for each separate portfolio element.

Rest of the sections is made in similar approach. Remember to preserve original indentation to avoid issues.
